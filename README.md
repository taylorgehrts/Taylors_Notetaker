## Description
This is a simple note taking app that lets you add notes to a json file. It also allows you to delete notes.  This was a Project that helped me understand routes a little better as well as the importance of modularization. I am using Express.js to deal with the api calls and routes.

## Installation
simply visit the link to the deployed site https://taylors-note-taking-app-301b8f6019ba.herokuapp.com/notes

## Usage
When you have launched the site click on get started, this will take you to the notes page.  Start by editing the title and note text, once you have a note you want to save click the save icon at the top of the page.  To delete a note hit the trash icon next to the note you would like to delete.
